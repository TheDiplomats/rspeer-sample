This is the first of potentially many bot scripts using RSPeer

Tutorial Estimated time: 30-45 mins

Before getting started, you will need to do several things:

0. Download intellij idea if you haven't already! Community Edition - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

1. Create an account with RSPeer following this link - https://discourse.rspeer.org/

2. Download the RSPeer client along with any additional dependencies, such as 
the OpenJdk, thankfully the client does most of it for you download here -
https://rspeer.org/resources/download/

3. For bot development download the rspeer.jar you can find it here - https://services.rspeer.org/api/bot/currentJar

4. Join the discord and verify your forum account in order to get more clients
to run simultaneously - https://discordapp.com/invite/UVp7Evz

5. Here is an easy way to setup your dev environment for your first script
I recommend just watching the video linked in the document - https://docs.rspeer.org/docs/setting-up-dev-environment
After you have successfully finished your dev setup I suggest you save
your project as a template to save time and ensure all your rolling scripts
are saved to the same directory, here is the official docs of how to do this
from Intellij https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/saving-project-as-template.html

6. It helps if you already have proxy solutions figured out you can configure
this from your dashboard, don't forget to have your credentials ready and
the client running to jump start https://app.rspeer.org
